This is a *formal* R package, meaning 
*of form* only.  It has the most of 
the required components of an R pacakage while 
missing some important components that 
a *correct* package normally has.  It 
is expected that the user is to copy 
and paste the codes directly to the 
R system, and look up the manual *manually*.
